MissingOutputException in rule sv_cutesv_annotsv in file /data2/mbaragli/python_app/app_python/Snakefile, line 207:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/data2/mbaragli/python_app/app_python/work_dir/PROVA/sv/PROVA_cutesv_annotsv.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
